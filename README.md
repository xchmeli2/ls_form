## 📖 About The Project

This project was developed as part of a school research assignment. Its purpose is to gather crowdsourced data on locations in New York City that residents or visitors feel are unsafe during nighttime hours.

The data collected includes:

- **Geolocation:** Precise latitude and longitude  
- **Safety Issues:** Poor lighting, isolation, harassment, etc.  
- **Time of Day:** When the area feels most unsafe  

The aggregated data will help visualize safety patterns and highlight areas that may benefit from urban improvements such as better streetlights or increased patrol presence.
