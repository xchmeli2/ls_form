📖 About The Project

This project is part of a school research assignment. The goal is to crowdsource data on locations in New York City that residents or visitors feel are unsafe during nighttime hours.

The data collected includes:

Geolocation: Precise latitude and longitude of the incident/area.

Safety Issues: Poor lighting, isolation, harassment, etc.

Time: When the location feels most unsafe.

The aggregated data will be used to visualize safety patterns and identify areas that may need urban improvements (better streetlights, more patrols, etc.).

🚀 Features

Interactive Map: Built with Leaflet.js and OpenStreetMap.

Pin Dropping: Users can click or drag to pinpoint exact locations.

Mobile Responsive: Works seamlessly on smartphones and desktops.

Data Collection: connected to Google Sheets via SheetMonkey for analysis.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML5 & CSS3: For structure and modern, responsive design.

JavaScript: For map logic and interactivity.

Leaflet.js: Open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps.

SheetMonkey: Backend service to handle form submissions without a server.

GitHub Pages: For hosting the application.

📊 How It Works

Select Location: The user clicks on the map to place a red marker.

Coordinates: The application automatically captures the Latitude and Longitude.

Details: The user selects the type of safety issue from a dropdown menu.
